## Reflections

1. I've learned basic definition about TypeScript(further - TS), that it's a superset of JavaScript; got to know about types in TS. I have put into practice the following: installed TS to the project(not globally); configured tsconfig.json file. Gained knowledge contributed to my development skills: I set up my first TS project and compiled TS to JavaScript.
2. I've learned about typed variables in TS, main thought is that I should avoid using any when it's not necessary(it leads to losing type safety). I have put into practice the following: created emun type. Gained knowledge contributed to my development skills: now I know the way to declare variables using primitive, objects, union and intersection types.
3. Interfaces describes "type" of the object, it helps to make sure that we are passing the right parameters. I declared and implemented interfaces in practice, used interface as a type in a variable declaration. Gained knowledge about describing API with the help of interfaces(interface implementation helps to clarify function parameters and return types). In practical part of this module I declared two interfaces(extended one of them) and passed parameters to functions as an object with type of declared interface.
