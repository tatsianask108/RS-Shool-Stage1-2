## Reflections

1. I've learned basic definition about TypeScript(further - TS), that it's a superset of JavaScript; got to know about types in TS. I have put into practice the following: installed TS to the project(not globally); configured tsconfig.json file. Gained knowledge contributed to my development skills: I set up my first TS project and compiled TS to JavaScript.
2. I've learned about typed variables in TS, main thought is that I should avoid using any when it's not necessary(it leads to losing type safety). I have put into practice the following: created emun type. Gained knowledge contributed to my development skills: now I know the way to declare variables using primitive, objects, union and intersection types.
3. Interfaces describes "type" of the object, it helps to make sure that we are passing the right parameters. I declared and implemented interfaces in practice, used interface as a type in a variable declaration. Gained knowledge about describing API with the help of interfaces(interface implementation helps to clarify function parameters and return types). In practical part of this module I declared two interfaces(extended one of them) and passed parameters to functions as an object with type of declared interface.
4. Now I know the benefits of using types in functions: TS simplifies the development of functions and makes them easier to troubleshoot; TS prevent from passing values that shouldn't be passed to functions; provides autocomplete support when creating the function logic. I have put into practice the following: I defined function type and set that type to two functions(sortAscending, sortDescending); converted a JS function to TS with strongly typed parameters, union type and return types. Gained knowledge contributed to my development skills: I am able to use types in functions.
5. In TS, classes come with extra features to make them more powerful and reliable. These include specifying types for class members, controlling access to them with access modifiers like public or private, and defining whether parameters are required or optional. I've practiced this by actually creating classes with these annotations and modifiers. This experience has improved my understanding of how to use classes effectively in TS, enhancing my development skills in the process.
6. The main essence of Generics in TS: generics define one or more type variables to identify the type or types that you will pass to the component, enclosed in angle brackets (< >). When using with functions, after specifying the type variable, it is possible to use it in place of the type in parameters, the return type, or anywhere else in the function that you would add a type annotation. Also, it's possible to use multiple type variables in format < Type1, Type2 >. type guards with generics. I practiced to declare a class by using a generic to contributed to my development skills.
7. In this module, I learned how to organize my code using modules in TypeScript. I discovered how to import external type libraries and practiced using exports and imports within TS modules. Additionally, I installed a type library named 'dotenv', which enhanced my development skills further.
8. In TS, namespaces are like containers that group related code together, such as variables, functions, interfaces, or classes. The main idea is that code inside a namespace is pulled from the global scope into the scope of the namespace, helping to prevent naming conflicts between different parts of your code. I practiced creating namespaces, exporting functions, and interfaces. It's worth noting that it's generally not recommended to mix namespaces and modules in the same project.
