### Hello everyone!  
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to this video.  This is a self-introduction video that I am recording as a part of training at the Rolling Scopes School. My name is **Tanya**, I'm from **Minsk, Belarus**, nice to meet you.

I would introduce myself as a **junior frontend developer**.

I have a non-technical background. I graduated from *medical* university and used to work as a *dentist*.

However, I’ve always been intrigued by programming and all that stuff. I just  did not think that I could handle at least something in programming. 
>But once I tried, programming turned out to be quite interesting and not so impossible as I thought it would be.

I got to know about RSS. I investigated about what frontend is, dived into YouTubevideos on HTML, CSS, JS topicks.

After a few months of investigation and self-learning I finally understood that I want to grow in this field and made a decision to *quit my job.*

>So, for 7 months now, I’ve been studying at RSS. I dedicate almost all my free time to studying, and my motivation is only growing.

During studying I enjoy all our tasks. When I work on creating layouts via html and CSS– I enjoy it, I want to go deeper, get to know all that cool CSS features. On the other hand, when it comes to JS,  I like to work on that kind of tasks and find solutions using JS. I have several projects in my portfolio on github, for example: coffee-house two pages website, nonograms and hangman game, audio-player.

>Actually, I’m already waiting for the moment of employment and starting my career. But understand that it’s necessary to gain much more skills. So, I’m planning to continue studying at RSS and learn a framework.

But I love what I'm doing. And with every new task I gain more and more confidence that I can handle all these technical tasks challenges.

And at the end of the video a few words about my hobbies. I love nature and enjoy go hiking with friends during spring, summer and autumn seasons. I also have a passion for perfumery, I have a small collection of perfumes, I love to explore new fragrances.
